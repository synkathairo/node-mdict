These MDict databases are derived from the CC-CEDict project,  under the  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.

The databases are:
1. pin2eng.mdx - a database searchable by pinyin with tone numbers
2. chs2eng.mdx - a database searchable by simplified Chinese characters.

(in spite of naming, both databases have Chinese, pinyin and English in the definitions.)

These converted databases omit a number of records from the original due to undisplayable characters.  These are mostly Japanese, Korean or unicode "compatibility" characters.  
They contain 63973 entries.
Traditional Chinese characters have been removed (although it is possible that due to shortcomings of the conversion process, a few remain in the definitions.)
No attempt has been made to correct errors and duplications from the original CC-CEDict database.

The conversion was done with perl scripts to extract and reformat the data, and Rayman Zhang's MdxBuilder v2.5 to build the databases.
These databases built 5 September 2008.
The only difference from the May 2008 version is that the display style has been modified so that Chinese characters are larger on screen.
